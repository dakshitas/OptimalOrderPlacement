# Cont & Kukanov Smart Order Router Backtest

This project implements and evaluates a static smart order routing strategy based on the cost model proposed by **Cont & Kukanov (2014)**. The router aims to minimize execution cost when buying 5,000 shares across multiple venues by optimizing overfill, underfill, and queue risk penalties.

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Summary

- **Allocator Logic**: Implemented exactly as per the `allocator_pseudocode.txt`, generating all feasible share allocations per snapshot and selecting the one with the lowest expected cost.
- **Backtest Engine**: Replays a message stream from `l1_day.csv`, feeds venue-level snapshots into the allocator, simulates order execution up to the posted ask size, and rolls forward unfilled quantity.
- **Parameter Search**: Conducted a grid search over:
  - `lambda_over âˆˆ {0.001, 0.01, 0.1}`
  - `lambda_under âˆˆ {0.001, 0.01, 0.1}`
  - `theta_queue âˆˆ {0.0001, 0.001, 0.01}`  
  Best parameters selected based on minimum total cost over the execution window.
